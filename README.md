### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**R3dsc4rf/R3dsc4rf** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Improving and verifying my programming skills. I am right now a Student at alfatraining Bildungszentrum GmbH (Germany)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python / C++ / QT
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with basic GitHub mechanics. E.g. how to make a clear READme.md, a clear code, ... avoid beginner mistakes
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Anything. If I do not know the answer, we will find it out together. :-)
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: jan.elsasser@outlook.de
- âš¡ Fun fact: **21** is just half the answer
